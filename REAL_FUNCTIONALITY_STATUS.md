## 🔄 OPTIONAL (Can Be Enhanced)

### 1. Derivatives Data
**Status:** Schema Ready, Integration Optional

```
⚪ IV Rank - Schema ready, can add NSE options API
⚪ PCR (Put-Call Ratio) - Schema ready
⚪ OI Changes - Schema ready
⚪ Futures Basis - Schema ready

Impact: None - System works without these
Enhancement: Add NSE derivatives API integration
```

### 2. Flow Data (FPI/DII)
**Status:** Schema Ready, Integration Optional

```
⚪ FPI Flows - Schema ready
⚪ DII Flows - Schema ready

Impact: None - System works without these
Enhancement: Add data provider integration
```

### 3. Sector Mapping
**Status:** Framework Ready, Optional

```
⚪ Sector classification - Can use Upstox metadata
⚪ Sector exposure calculation - Framework ready

Impact: Minimal - Exposure check still validates position size
Enhancement: Add Upstox instrument sector data
```

### 4. Advanced NLP
**Status:** Basic Working, Can Enhance

```
✅ Basic event classification - Working
⚪ FinBERT - Can integrate
⚪ Named Entity Recognition - Can add
⚪ Sentiment analysis - Can enhance

Impact: None - Basic NLP functional
Enhancement: Add advanced NLP models
```

### 5. News API
**Status:** Integrated, Needs API Key

```
✅ NewsAPI integration - Implemented
⚠️ Requires API key - Free tier available

Impact: System works without it (NSE filings still work)
Enhancement: Add NewsAPI key to .env
```
